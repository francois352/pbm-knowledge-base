Executive  Summary
 Photobiomodulation  (PBM)  is  a  non-invasive  light  therapy  that  stimulates  cells  for  
energy
 
production
 
and
 
repair.
 
Its
 
safety
 
and
 
non-pharmacological
 
nature
 
are
 
attractive
 
for
 
research,
 
especially
 
where
 
traditional
 
treatments
 
fall
 
short.
 
However,
 
its
 
clinical
 
application
 
is
 
hindered
 
by
 
methodological
 
variability
 
and
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
standardized
 
protocols.
 
Inconsistent
 
research
 
designs
 
impede
 
establishing
 
consistent
 
efficacy
 
and
 
clinical
 
guidelines.
 
Unified
 
research
 
efforts
 
are
 
needed
 
for
 
PBM
 
to
 
transition
 
from
 
experimental
 
to
 
established
 
medical
 
practice.
 
Introduction  to  Photobiomodulation  (PBM)  Photobiomodulation  (PBM)  is  a  therapeutic  technique  that  harnesses  non-ionizing  
electromagnetic
 
energy,
 
specifically
 
within
 
the
 
red
 
(620–700
 
nm)
 
and
 
near-infrared
 
(NIR,
 
700–1100
 
nm)
 
light
 
spectrums,
 
to
 
elicit
 
photochemical
 
reactions
 
in
 
biological
 
tissues
 
without
 
generating
 
significant
 
heat.
4
 This  modality,  historically  known  as  
low-level
 
light
 
therapy
 
(LLLT),
 
has
 
seen
 
its
 
terminology
 
evolve,
 
with
 
PBM
 
becoming
 
the
 
preferred
 
term.
 
This
 
shift
 
was
 
formally
 
recognized
 
in
 
2015
 
when
 
the
 
U.S.
 
National
 
Library
 
of
 
Medicine
 
designated
 
PBM
 
as
 
an
 
official
 
Medical
 
Subject
 
Heading
 
(MeSH)
 
term.
4
 The  adoption  of  PBM  as  a  MeSH  term  signifies  a  maturation  and  formal  
acceptance
 
of
 
the
 
field
 
within
 
the
 
broader
 
medical
 
and
 
scientific
 
community.
 
This
 
change
 
reflects
 
a
 
growing
 
consensus
 
among
 
experts
 
regarding
 
PBM's
 
distinct
 
mechanisms
 
and
 
applications,
 
indicating
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
increasingly
 
recognized
 
as
 
a
 
legitimate
 
area
 
of
 
biomedical
 
research
 
and
 
a
 
potential
 
therapeutic
 
intervention,
 
warranting
 
dedicated
 
categorization
 
and
 
study.
 
PBM
 
operates
 
at
 
relatively
 
low
 
power
 
densities,
 
typically
 
between
 
5
 
mW
 
and
 
500
 
mW,
 
which
 
ensures
 
that
 
it
 
induces
 
therapeutic
 
effects
 
without
 
causing
 
significant
 
thermal
 
impact
 
or
 
structural
 
alterations
 
to
 
the
 
target
 
tissues.
4  

--- Page 4 ---

The  core  mechanism  of  PBM  revolves  around  the  absorption  of  specific  light  
wavelengths
 
by
 
mitochondrial
 
chromophores,
 
with
 
cytochrome
 
c
 
oxidase
 
(CcO)
 
being
 
the
 
primary
 
absorber.
1
 This  absorption  event  initiates  a  cascade  of  cellular  events  that  
collectively
 
enhance
 
cellular
 
metabolism,
 
boost
 
energy
 
production
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
adenosine
 
triphosphate
 
(ATP),
 
and
 
stimulate
 
various
 
repair
 
mechanisms
 
within
 
the
 
cells.

Part  1:  Photobiomodulation  as  Presented  by  Vielight  Vielight  describes  Photobiomodulation  as  a  therapy  that  employs  non-ionizing  
electromagnetic
 
energy
 
to
 
induce
 
photochemical
 
changes
 
in
 
cells,
 
highlighting
 
the
 
particular
 
responsiveness
 
of
 
mitochondria
 
to
 
red
 
and
 
near-infrared
 
(NIR)
 
photons.
5
 A  
central
 
component
 
in
 
this
 
process
 
is
 
cytochrome
 
oxidase
 
c,
 
identified
 
as
 
a
 
chromophore
 
capable
 
of
 
accepting
 
photonic
 
energy
 
at
 
specific
 
wavelengths,
 
especially
 
when
 
its
 
function
 
is
 
suboptimal.

Core  Scientific  Principles  and  Proposed  Mechanisms  According  to  Vielight,  PBM  operates  through  three  primary  bioenergetic  pathways:  
●  ATP  Production:  Low-level  visible  red  to  NIR  light  energy  is  absorbed  by  
mitochondria
 
and
 
subsequently
 
converted
 
into
 
ATP,
 
which
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
fundamental
 
energy
 
currency
 
for
 
all
 
cellular
 
functions.
5  
●  Cellular  Repair  and  Healing:  The  PBM  process  generates  mild  oxidants,  
specifically
 
Reactive
 
Oxygen
 
Species
 
(ROS).
 
These
 
ROS,
 
rather
 
than
 
causing
 
damage,
 
activate
 
gene
 
transcription
 
pathways,
 
which
 
in
 
turn
 
promote
 
cellular
 
repair
 
and
 
healing
 
processes.
5  
●  Nitric  Oxide  Release:  PBM  facilitates  the  release  of  nitric  oxide  (NO),  effectively  
"unclogging"
 
the
 
cellular
 
chain.
 
Nitric
 
oxide
 
is
 
vital
 
for
 
cell
 
communication
 
and
 
plays
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
dilating
 
blood
 
vessels,
 
thereby
 
improving
 
local
 
circulation.
5  
The  specific  molecular  pathways  involved  are  detailed  as:  ATP  →  cAMP  →  Jun/Fos  →  
AP-1,
 
which
 
stimulates
 
gene
 
transcription;
 
ROS
 
→
 
PKD
 
→
 
IkB
 
+
 
NF-
κ
B
 
→
 
NF-
κ
B,
 
also
 
stimulating
 
gene
 
transcription;
 
and
 
the
 
direct
 
action
 
of
 
Nitric
 
Oxide
 
(NO).
5
 Vielight  
emphasizes
 
the
 
principles
 
of
 
photobiology,
 
referencing
 
the
 
Grotthus-Draper
 
law,
 
which
 
states
 
that
 
biological
 
reactions
 
are
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
absorption
 
of
 
radiation
 
at
 
specific
 
wavelengths,
 
meaning
 
no
 
absorption
 
equates
 
to
 
no
 
reaction.
5  
Key  Parameters  for  Optimal  Application  Vielight  underscores  that  for  PBM  to  yield  optimal  results,  specific  parameters  must  
be
 
meticulously
 
controlled:
 
●  Wavelength:  The  selection  of  the  correct  wavelength,  typically  between  633-810  
nm,
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
ensuring
 
optimal
 
absorption
 
by
 
target
 
cells
 
or
 
chromophores.
 
This
 
adherence
 
to
 
the
 
Grotthus-Draper
 
law
 
is
 
fundamental
 
for
 
initiating
 
the
 
desired
 
photochemical
 
reactions.
5  
●  Photon  Intensity  (Power  Density):  The  spectral  irradiance  or  power  density  
(measured
 
in
 
W/cm²)
 
must
 
be
 
adequate
 
to
 
ensure
 
sufficient
 
photon
 
absorption.
 
It
 
is
 
cautioned
 
that
 
excessive
 
intensity
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
undesirable
 
heat
 
transformation
 
within
 
the
 
target
 
tissue,
 
potentially
 
negating
 
therapeutic
 
benefits
 
or
 
causing
 
harm.
5  
●  Dose  or  Fluence:  The  total  energy  delivered,  or  fluence  (J/cm²),  must  also  be  
adequate.
 
Vielight
 
notes
 
that
 
simply
 
prolonging
 
the
 
irradiation
 
time
 
may
 
not
 
achieve
 
the
 
desired
 
therapeutic
 
outcome
 
if
 
the
 
power
 
density
 
is
 
too
 
low,
 
as
 
the
 
Bunsen-Roscoe
 
law
 
of
 
reciprocity
 
does
 
not
 
hold
 
true
 
for
 
low
 
incident
 
power
 
densities.
5

Vielight's  emphasis  on  these  specific  PBM  parameters  and  their  adherence  to  
established
 
photobiological
 
laws
 
suggests
 
a
 
scientifically
 
grounded
 
approach
 
to
 
their
 
technology.
5
 However,  this  detailed  theoretical  understanding  of  optimal  parameters  
contrasts
 
sharply
 
with
 
the
 
broader
 
scientific
 
literature,
 
which
 
frequently
 
highlights
 
a
 
significant
 
lack
 
of
 
standardized
 
protocols
 
and
 
considerable
 
methodological
 
variability
 
across
 
PBM
 
studies.
3
 This  disparity  indicates  that  while  the  foundational  biophysical  
requirements
 
for
 
PBM
 
are
 
understood,
 
the
 
practical
 
implementation
 
and
 
consistency
 
of
 
these
 
parameters
 
in
 
diverse
 
clinical
 
research
 
settings
 
remain
 
a
 
substantial
 
challenge
 
for
 
the
 
field
 
at
 
large.
 
The
 
complexity
 
of
 
translating
 
theoretical
 
principles
 
into
 
consistently
 
effective
 
and
 
reproducible
 
clinical
 
protocols
 
is
 
a
 
major
 
hurdle.

Brain  Bioenergetics  and  Mechanisms  of  Brain  PBM  Vielight  specifically  details  the  application  of  PBM  to  the  brain,  termed  
photoneuromodulation.
 
Near-infrared
 
light
 
(NIR)
 
is
 
described
 
as
 
stimulating
 
mitochondrial
 
respiration
 
in
 
neurons
 
by
 
donating
 
photons
 
absorbed
 
by
 
cytochrome
 
oxidase.
5
 This  process  leads  to  an  increase  in  brain  cytochrome  oxidase  enzymatic  
activity
 
and
 
oxygen
 
consumption,
 
which
 
consequently
 
boosts
 
ATP
 
production
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
metabolic
 
action
 
of
 
NIR
 
light.
5
 Notably,  NIR  light  energy  is  capable  of  entering  
brain
 
mitochondria
 
transcranially
 
and
 
directly
 
photostimulating
 
cytochrome
 
oxidase
 

--- Page 8 ---

activity,  independent  of  electrons  derived  from  food  substrates.
5  
Beyond  ATP  synthesis,  photon  absorption  by  ion  channels  also  triggers  the  release  of  
Ca²
⁺
,
 
which
 
in
 
turn
 
activates
 
transcription
 
factors
 
and
 
gene
 
expression.
5
 In  neuronal  
cells
 
experiencing
 
hypoxia,
 
NIR
 
photons
 
cause
 
cytochrome-C
 
oxidase
 
(CCO)
 
to
 
release
 
nitric
 
oxide,
 
resulting
 
in
 
increased
 
local
 
blood
 
flow
 
and
 
vasodilation.
5
 
Furthermore,
 
a
 
brief
 
burst
 
of
 
reactive
 
oxygen
 
species
 
(ROS)
 
within
 
the
 
neuron
 
cell
 
activates
 
signaling
 
pathways,
 
leading
 
to
 
redox-sensitive
 
gene
 
activation
 
and
 
gene
 
expression
 
for
 
crucial
 
cellular
 
processes
 
such
 
as
 
proliferation,
 
migration,
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
anti-inflammatory
 
cytokines,
 
and
 
growth
 
factors.
5  
Claimed  Benefits  and  Target  Conditions  Brain  photobiomodulation,  as  presented  by  Vielight,  is  claimed  to  offer  several  
benefits,
 
including
 
the
 
healing
 
and
 
regeneration
 
of
 
damaged
 
brain
 
cells,
 
improvement
 
of
 
cerebral
 
blood
 
circulation,
 
reduction
 
of
 
inflammation
 
and
 
toxicity,
 
and
 
enhancement
 
of
 
overall
 
brain
 
efficiency
 
and
 
performance
 
through
 
better
 
signaling
 
and
 
repaired
 
neuronal
 
connectivity.
5  
The  scientific  literature  on  brain  PBM  is  rapidly  expanding,  with  over  220  published  
studies.
 
Vielight
 
identifies
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
target
 
conditions
 
for
 
brain
 
PBM,
 
including
 
Alzheimer’s
 
Disease
 
and
 
Dementia,
 
Parkinson’s
 
Disease,
 
Depression/Anxiety,
 
Traumatic
 
Brain
 
Injury
 
(TBI),
 
Autism
 
Spectrum
 
Disorder
 
(ASD),
 
and
 
even
 
respiratory
 
symptoms
 
associated
 
with
 
Covid-19,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
PTSD
 
and
 
Gulf
 
War
 
Illness.
 
The
 
technology
 
is
 
also
 
noted
 
to
 
influence
 
EEG
 
neural
 
activity
 
when
 
pulsed
 
NIR
 
energy
 
is
 
applied.
5  
Unique  Aspects  of  Vielight  Technology  Vielight  highlights  several  unique  aspects  of  its  technology,  particularly  concerning  
brain
 
PBM:
 
●  NIR  Light  Penetration:  The  NIR  spectrum  is  emphasized  for  its  ability  to  provide  
the
 
deepest
 
penetration
 
into
 
brain
 
tissues.
 
The
 
optimal
 
wavelength
 
for
 
this
 
is
 
stated
 
as
 
810
 
nm,
 
falling
 
within
 
the
 
"NIR
 
window,"
 
a
 
spectral
 
range
 
characterized
 
by
 
minimal
 
absorption
 
by
 
both
 
blood
 
at
 
shorter
 
wavelengths
 
and
 
water
 
at
 
longer
 
wavelengths.
5  
●  LED  Technology  Preference:  Vielight  asserts  that  independent  studies  support  
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
NIR
 
LED
 
technology
 
in
 
penetrating
 
the
 
skull
 
and
 
irradiating
 
the
 
brain.
 
They
 
contend
 
that
 
lasers
 
are
 
not
 
necessary
 
and,
 
in
 
fact,
 
carry
 
unnecessary
 
dangers
 
due
 
to
 
coherent
 
light
 
energy,
 
which
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
issues
 
like
 
power
 
throttling
 
and
 
overheating.
 
The
 
common
 
effective
 
wavelength
 
range
 
highlighted
 
is
 

--- Page 9 ---

800-830nm,  aligning  with  the  body’s  optical  window.
5
 This  preference  for  LED  
technology
 
over
 
lasers
 
for
 
transcranial
 
PBM,
 
driven
 
by
 
safety
 
concerns,
 
represents
 
a
 
strategic
 
positioning
 
within
 
the
 
PBM
 
device
 
market.
 
It
 
suggests
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
user
 
safety
 
and
 
accessibility
 
while
 
maintaining
 
claims
 
of
 
comparable
 
efficacy
 
for
 
brain
 
penetration,
 
potentially
 
broadening
 
the
 
adoption
 
of
 
PBM
 
devices,
 
including
 
for
 
home
 
use.
 ●  Vielight  in  Research:  The  company's  technology  is  noted  to  be  actively  utilized  in  
research
 
aimed
 
at
 
determining
 
optimal
 
PBM
 
parameters,
 
often
 
integrating
 
brain
 
imaging
 
and
 
signaling
 
techniques.
 
Many
 
future
 
research
 
outcomes
 
are
 
anticipated
 
to
 
feature
 
Vielight
 
technology.
5  
●  Systemic  PBM:  The  discussion  also  extends  to  low-level  systemic  PBM  applied  
via
 
blood,
 
mentioning
 
ongoing
 
research
 
into
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
circulating
 
cell-free
 
respiratory
 
competent
 
mitochondria,
 
hemoglobin
 
oxygenation,
 
vasodilation,
 
protection
 
of
 
red
 
blood
 
cells
 
against
 
oxidative
 
stress,
 
wound
 
healing
 
facilitated
 
by
 
the
 
immune
 
system,
 
and
 
intranasal
 
laser
 
therapy.

Part  2:  External  Scientific  Validation,  Elaboration,  and  Critical  
Analysis
 
of
 
Photobiomodulation
 This  section  expands  upon  the  information  presented  by  Vielight,  incorporating  
findings
 
from
 
external
 
scientific
 
literature
 
to
 
validate,
 
elaborate
 
on,
 
and
 
critically
 
assess
 
the
 
mechanisms,
 
applications,
 
and
 
limitations
 
of
 
PBM.
 
Deep  Dive  into  Cellular  and  Molecular  Mechanisms  External  research  consistently  corroborates  that  the  primary  mechanism  of  PBM  
involves
 
the
 
stimulation
 
of
 
mitochondrial
 
cytochrome
 
C
 
oxidase
 
(CcO).
1
 This  
absorption
 
of
 
light
 
energy
 
by
 
CcO,
 
a
 
key
 
chromophore
 
within
 
the
 
mitochondrial
 
respiratory
 
chain,
 
is
 
consistently
 
identified
 
across
 
independent
 
research
 
sources,
 
solidifying
 
the
 
scientific
 
consensus
 
around
 
this
 
initial
 
molecular
 
event
 
in
 
PBM.
 
This
 
convergence
 
validates
 
Vielight's
 
foundational
 
mechanistic
 
claim
 
and
 
provides
 
a
 
robust
 
basis
 
for
 
understanding
 
the
 
subsequent
 
cellular
 
cascade.
 
The
 
light
 
absorption
 
by
 
CcO
 
leads
 
to
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
ATP
 
synthesis,
 
thereby
 
providing
 
more
 
cellular
 
energy.
3  
Beyond  simple  ATP  production,  external  research  reveals  a  more  complex  and  
multi-faceted
 
mechanistic
 
cascade:
 
●  Regulation  of  Signaling  Molecules:  PBM  initiates  a  cascade  of  cellular  events  
that
 
extend
 
beyond
 
basic
 
energy
 
production.
 
It
 
modulates
 
the
 
levels
 
of
 
crucial
 
signaling
 
molecules
 
such
 
as
 
intracellular
 
calcium
 
(Ca²
⁺
)
 
and
 
reactive
 
oxygen
 
species
 
(ROS).
 
Photon
 
absorption
 
by
 
ion
 
channels
 
results
 
in
 
the
 
release
 
of
 
Ca²
⁺
,
 

--- Page 10 ---

which  in  turn  activates  transcription  factors  and  gene  expression.
3
 A  transient  
burst
 
of
 
ROS
 
within
 
the
 
cell
 
activates
 
specific
 
signaling
 
pathways,
 
leading
 
to
 
redox-sensitive
 
gene
 
activation
 
and
 
gene
 
expression
 
that
 
promotes
 
cellular
 
proliferation,
 
migration,
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
anti-inflammatory
 
cytokines,
 
and
 
growth
 
factors.
5  
●  Nitric  Oxide  (NO)  Release:  PBM  facilitates  the  release  of  nitric  oxide  from  
cytochrome
 
c
 
oxidase,
 
particularly
 
in
 
hypoxic
 
neuronal
 
cells.
 
This
 
release
 
of
 
NO
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
cell
 
communication,
 
enhances
 
local
 
blood
 
flow,
 
and
 
promotes
 
vasodilation,
 
thereby
 
improving
 
circulation.
3  
●  Anti-inflammatory  Effects:  PBM  exhibits  significant  anti-inflammatory  
properties.
 
It
 
is
 
capable
 
of
 
altering
 
the
 
phenotype
 
of
 
activated
 
macrophage
 
cell
 
lines
 
from
 
the
 
pro-inflammatory
 
M1
 
phenotype
 
to
 
the
 
anti-inflammatory
 
M2
 
phenotype.
3
 This  modulation  of  immune  responses  represents  a  key  therapeutic  
pathway.
2  
●  Cerebral  Blood  Flow  Enhancement:  In  addition  to  vasodilation  mediated  by  NO,  
PBM
 
can
 
directly
 
improve
 
cerebral
 
blood
 
flow
 
by
 
modifying
 
the
 
elasticity
 
and
 
resistance
 
of
 
the
 
cerebrovascular
 
wall
 
of
 
blood
 
arteries.
3
 This  direct  effect  on  
vascular
 
dynamics
 
contributes
 
to
 
enhanced
 
oxygen
 
and
 
nutrient
 
delivery
 
to
 
tissues.
 ●  Mitochondrial  Dynamics  and  Neuroprotection:  Research  indicates  that  the  
dysregulation
 
of
 
mitochondrial
 
dynamics,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
balance
 
between
 
fusion
 
and
 
fission
 
homeostasis,
 
can
 
be
 
induced
 
by
 
factors
 
like
 
SARS-CoV-2.
 
This
 
dysregulation
 
can
 
impair
 
proper
 
mitochondrial
 
function
 
and
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
formation
 
of
 
phase-separated
 
amyloid
 
crystalline
 
aggregates,
 
a
 
hallmark
 
feature
 
of
 
aging-related
 
neurodegenerative
 
disorders.
6
 PBM's  demonstrated  ability  to  
stimulate
 
mitochondrial
 
function
 
2
 suggests  a  potential  to  counteract  such  
dysregulation,
 
thereby
 
offering
 
neuroprotective
 
effects.
 
This
 
specific
 
molecular
 
connection
 
provides
 
a
 
compelling
 
rationale
 
for
 
PBM's
 
potential
 
in
 
conditions
 
like
 
Neuro-PASC
 
(Post-Acute
 
Sequelae
 
of
 
COVID-19)
 
and
 
Alzheimer's
 
disease,
 
suggesting
 
that
 
PBM
 
could
 
address
 
a
 
fundamental
 
pathological
 
pathway
 
rather
 
than
 
merely
 
alleviating
 
symptoms.
 
The
 
implication
 
is
 
that
 
if
 
PBM
 
can
 
restore
 
mitochondrial
 
function
 
and
 
dynamics,
 
it
 
could
 
directly
 
counteract
 
specific
 
pathological
 
processes,
 
moving
 
beyond
 
symptomatic
 
relief
 
to
 
address
 
root
 
causes.
 
The  detailed  mechanistic  understanding  provided  by  external  research,  encompassing  
gene
 
expression,
 
immune
 
modulation
 
through
 
macrophage
 
phenotype
 
shifts,
 
and
 
direct
 
cerebrovascular
 
effects,
 
indicates
 
that
 
PBM's
 
therapeutic
 
potential
 
extends
 
beyond
 
basic
 
energy
 
metabolism.
 
It
 
suggests
 
that
 
PBM
 
influences
 
fundamental
 

--- Page 11 ---

cellular  signaling  and  systemic  physiological  responses,  offering  a  broader  array  of  
therapeutic
 
targets
 
than
 
initially
 
perceived,
 
including
 
addressing
 
underlying
 
inflammatory
 
and
 
vascular
 
components
 
of
 
disease.
 
Clinical  Evidence  and  Applications  The  clinical  evidence  for  PBM's  efficacy  spans  a  wide  range  of  conditions,  particularly  
in
 
neurological
 
and
 
psychiatric
 
disorders,
 
and
 
is
 
expanding
 
into
 
other
 
therapeutic
 
areas.
 
Neurodegenerative  and  Psychiatric  Disorders  
●  Alzheimer’s  Disease  and  Dementia:  While  Vielight  claims  PBM  increases  
cerebral
 
perfusion
 
and
 
connectivity
 
within
 
the
 
Default
 
Mode
 
Network
 
(DMN)
 
5
,  
external
 
evidence
 
strongly
 
supports
 
PBM's
 
role
 
in
 
Alzheimer's
 
disease
 
(AD).
 
Studies
 
demonstrate
 
enhanced
 
neuronal
 
function,
 
reduced
 
oxidative
 
stress,
 
decreased
 
inflammation,
 
and
 
a
 
reduction
 
in
 
amyloid-beta
 
(A
β)
 
deposition.
2
 PBM  
may
 
also
 
elevate
 
vitamin
 
D
 
levels,
 
which
 
possess
 
neuroprotective,
 
antioxidant,
 
and
 
anti-inflammatory
 
properties,
 
and
 
contribute
 
to
 
maintaining
 
blood-brain
 
barrier
 
integrity
 
and
 
regulating
 
A
β
 
clearance.
2
 Clinical  studies  indicate  that  PBM  
stimulates
 
mitochondrial
 
function,
 
enhances
 
synaptic
 
plasticity,
 
and
 
improves
 
cognitive
 
performance.
2
 Specific  cognitive  improvements  observed  include  
statistically
 
significant
 
enhancements
 
in
 
Mini
 
Mental
 
State
 
Examination
 
(MMSE)
 
scores
 
2
,  improved  reaction  time,  increased  correct  responses,  better  memory  
retrieval
 
latency,
 
enhanced
 
story
 
recall,
 
higher
 
naming
 
test
 
scores,
 
and
 
improved
 
delayed
 
recall.
3
 Near-infrared  stimulation  has  been  shown  to  synchronize  
connections
 
within
 
the
 
DMN,
 
particularly
 
between
 
the
 
posterior
 
cingulate
 
cortex
 
and
 
lateral
 
parietal
 
cortex,
 
which
 
are
 
critical
 
for
 
episodic
 
memory.
3
 Innovative  
approaches,
 
such
 
as
 
brain–gut
 
PBM
 
therapy,
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
improvements
 
in
 
comprehension
 
and
 
execution
 
times.
3
 Furthermore,  combining  PBM  with  aerobic  
exercises
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
statistically
 
significant
 
changes
 
in
 
cognitive
 
and
 
physical
 
parameters
 
in
 
anemic
 
elderly
 
Alzheimer’s
 
patients.
3
 Transcranial  PBM  has  also  
been
 
confirmed
 
to
 
influence
 
open-eye
 
EEG
 
rhythms,
 
increasing
 
power
 
spectral
 
density
 
for
 
gamma
 
and
 
beta
 
frequency
 
bands.
3
 The  detailed,  specific  cognitive  
and
 
neurological
 
improvements
 
reported
 
in
 
external
 
research
 
move
 
beyond
 
general
 
"healing"
 
claims
 
to
 
quantifiable,
 
clinically
 
relevant
 
outcomes,
 
strengthening
 
the
 
empirical
 
basis
 
for
 
PBM's
 
neurotherapeutic
 
potential.
 ●  Parkinson’s  Disease:  Vielight  suggests  improvements  in  mobility,  cognition,  
dynamic
 
balance,
 
and
 
fine
 
motor
 
skills
 
5
,  and  the  National  Institute  on  Aging  (NIA)  
workshop
 
identified
 
PBM
 
as
 
having
 
potential
 
for
 
Parkinson's
 
disease.
1
 However,  a  
systematic
 
review
 
on
 
combined
 
transcranial
 
and
 
intra-oral
 
PBM
 
therapy
 
for
 

--- Page 12 ---

Parkinson's  disease  reported  mixed  results,  with  one  study  showing  no  
statistically
 
significant
 
overall
 
changes
 
in
 
measured
 
outcomes.
3
 While  some  
measures,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
spiral
 
(writing)
 
test
 
and
 
dynamic
 
step
 
test,
 
demonstrated
 
sensitivity
 
to
 
positive
 
change,
 
the
 
authors
 
attributed
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
broad
 
significance
 
to
 
the
 
inherent
 
variability
 
of
 
Parkinson’s
 
disease
 
symptoms,
 
suggesting
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
individualized
 
stimulation
 
sites
 
and
 
doses.
3
 The  mixed  
results
 
for
 
Parkinson's
 
disease,
 
contrasting
 
with
 
more
 
consistent
 
positive
 
findings
 
for
 
Alzheimer's
 
and
 
depression/anxiety,
 
suggest
 
that
 
PBM
 
efficacy
 
is
 
highly
 
condition-specific.
 
This
 
variation
 
likely
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
underlying
 
pathophysiology
 
of
 
the
 
disease
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
light
 
to
 
effectively
 
reach
 
the
 
target
 
tissues.
 
This
 
implies
 
that
 
a
 
"one-size-fits-all"
 
approach
 
to
 
PBM
 
application
 
is
 
unlikely
 
to
 
be
 
effective,
 
necessitating
 
tailored
 
protocols
 
that
 
consider
 
the
 
specific
 
neurobiological
 
underpinnings
 
of
 
each
 
disease.
 ●  Depression  and  Anxiety:  Vielight  notes  that  scientific  literature  suggests  PBM  
might
 
be
 
useful
 
for
 
depression
 
and
 
anxiety.
5
 External  studies  provide  strong  
supporting
 
evidence,
 
demonstrating
 
significant
 
improvement
 
in
 
HADS
 
(Hospital
 
Anxiety
 
and
 
Depression
 
Scale)
 
anxiety
 
and
 
depression
 
subscale
 
scores
 
in
 
university
 
students.
3
 Substantial  improvements  in  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  
Scale
 
scores
 
were
 
reported
 
for
 
patients
 
with
 
Major
 
Depressive
 
Disorder
 
(MDD)
 
treated
 
with
 
transcranial
 
PBM
 
compared
 
to
 
sham
 
treatment.
3
 For  Generalized  
Anxiety
 
Disorder
 
(GAD)
 
patients,
 
PBM
 
showed
 
significant
 
differences
 
in
 
Clinical
 
Global
 
Impressions—Severity
 
scale,
 
Hamilton
 
Anxiety
 
Scale,
 
and
 
Pittsburgh
 
Sleep
 
Quality
 
Index
 
scores.
3  
●  Traumatic  Brain  Injury  (TBI):  Vielight  claims  PBM  induces  positive  physiological  
changes
 
in
 
TBI.
5
 External  evidence  supports  this,  showing  improvements  in  
neuropsychological
 
tests
 
(e.g.,
 
Ray
 
Figure
 
Test,
 
Trail
 
Making
 
Test,
 
Verbal
 
Fluency,
 
Ray
 
Auditory
 
Verbal
 
Learning
 
Test)
 
and
 
a
 
significant
 
increase
 
in
 
peak
 
systolic
 
velocity
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
cerebral
 
arteries
 
in
 
chronic
 
TBI
 
patients.
3
 Significant  
improvements
 
in
 
cognitive
 
functions,
 
particularly
 
executive
 
functions
 
(Stroop
 
test)
 
and
 
verbal
 
memory
 
(California
 
Verbal
 
Learning
 
Test),
 
have
 
been
 
reported
 
in
 
chronic
 
mild
 
TBI
 
patients.
3
 Some  participants  with  chronic  TBI  symptoms  
self-reported
 
symptom
 
improvement,
 
enhanced
 
cognition,
 
and
 
better
 
mood
 
after
 
transcranial
 
LED
 
treatment,
 
though
 
other
 
influencing
 
factors
 
were
 
acknowledged.
3
 Studies  have  also  assessed  the  feasibility  and  safety  of  LLLT  
administered
 
acutely
 
after
 
moderate
 
TBI,
 
demonstrating
 
neuroreactivity
 
to
 
LLLT
 
in
 
white
 
matter
 
tracts.
3
 For  acute  ischemic  stroke,  initial  studies  (NEST-1)  indicated  
safety
 
and
 
effectiveness,
 
but
 
subsequent
 
larger
 
trials
 
(NEST-2
 
and
 
NEST-3)
 
did
 
not
 
meet
 
formal
 
statistical
 
significance
 
for
 
efficacy
 
or
 
were
 
terminated
 
due
 
to

futility.

Other  Emerging  Therapeutic  Applications  
●  Sleep  Regulation:  Current  scientific  evidence  suggests  that  PBM  has  the  
potential
 
to
 
influence
 
sleep
 
architecture,
 
duration,
 
and
 
quality
 
through
 
complex
 
interactions
 
with
 
cellular
 
metabolic
 
pathways
 
and
 
neurophysiological
 
mechanisms
 
governing
 
the
 
sleep-wake
 
cycle.
4
 However,  significant  research  gaps  persist  in  
fully
 
elucidating
 
the
 
precise
 
cellular
 
and
 
molecular
 
mechanisms
 
and
 
standardizing
 
protocols
 
for
 
sleep
 
applications.
4  
●  Knee  Osteoarthritis  (KOA):  High-energy  photobiomodulation  therapy  (H-PBMT)  
is
 
gaining
 
recognition
 
for
 
managing
 
KOA,
 
demonstrating
 
effectiveness
 
in
 
reducing
 
pain
 
and
 
improving
 
physical
 
function.
7
 Emerging  evidence  indicates  that  H-PBMT  
may
 
offer
 
benefits
 
beyond
 
symptomatic
 
relief
 
by
 
supporting
 
radiographic
 
and
 
structural
 
improvements,
 
such
 
as
 
enhancing
 
cartilage
 
metabolism,
 
stimulating
 
collagen
 
production,
 
and
 
reducing
 
synovial
 
inflammation.
7
 A  noticeable  gap  
remains
 
in
 
understanding
 
H-PBMT's
 
long-term
 
impact
 
on
 
radiographic
 
outcomes
 
and
 
structural
 
modifications
 
within
 
the
 
knee
 
joint.
7
 The  mention  of  PBM's  potential  
in
 
sleep
 
regulation
 
and
 
Knee
 
Osteoarthritis,
 
including
 
its
 
capacity
 
for
 
structural
 
improvements
 
in
 
KOA,
 
significantly
 
broadens
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
PBM
 
beyond
 
neurological
 
applications.
 
This
 
indicates
 
a
 
wider
 
therapeutic
 
versatility,
 
suggesting
 
that
 
PBM's
 
underlying
 
mechanisms
 
(e.g.,
 
anti-inflammatory,
 
regenerative)
 
are
 
applicable
 
across
 
diverse
 
tissue
 
types
 
and
 
disease
 
states,
 
implying
 
a
 
multi-system
 
therapeutic
 
potential.

Current  Limitations,  Research  Gaps,  and  Future  Directions  Despite  the  growing  body  of  evidence  supporting  PBM's  therapeutic  potential,  several  
significant
 
limitations
 
and
 
research
 
gaps
 
currently
 
impede
 
its
 
widespread
 
clinical
 
adoption
 
and
 
standardization.
 
Challenges  in  Standardization  and  Dosimetry  A  pervasive  issue  across  the  field  is  the  lack  of  standardized  intervention  
protocols
.
4
 There  is  an  urgent  need  to  establish  optimal  wavelengths,  dosage  
parameters,
 
treatment
 
durations,
 
and
 
delivery
 
methods
 
to
 
ensure
 
consistent
 
and
 
reproducible
 
results
 
across
 
different
 
studies
 
and
 
clinical
 
settings.
4
 This  
methodological
 
variability,
 
encompassing
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
wavelengths
 
(e.g.,
 
823
 
nm
 
to
 
1087
 
nm)
 
and
 
differing
 
stimulation
 
targets
 
(transcranial,
 
intranasal,
 
or
 
indirect),
 
significantly
 
impacts
 
tissue
 
penetration
 
and
 
often
 
renders
 
findings
 
incomparable.
3
 The  
recurring
 
emphasis
 
on
 
"standardization"
 
across
 
various
 
research
 
areas
 
(psychiatric
 
disorders,
 
sleep,
 
KOA)
 
represents
 
a
 
fundamental
 
barrier
 
to
 
PBM's
 
clinical
 
translation.
 
Without
 
standardized
 
protocols,
 
it
 
becomes
 
impossible
 
to
 
establish
 
consistent
 
efficacy,
 
develop
 
reliable
 
clinical
 
guidelines,
 
or
 
achieve
 
regulatory
 
approval
 
for
 
specific
 
indications.
 
This
 
situation
 
indicates
 
that
 
the
 
field,
 
despite
 
promising
 
preliminary
 
results,
 
remains
 
in
 
a
 
relatively
 
early,
 
exploratory
 
phase.
 
Furthermore,  optimizing  light  dosimetry  is  critical,  as  the  effectiveness  of  PBM  
therapy
 
is
 
highly
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
precise
 
amount
 
of
 
light
 
reaching
 
the
 
target
 
tissue
 
depth.
4
 Factors  such  as  skin  color  and  the  amount  of  subcutaneous  fat  can  
significantly
 
influence
 
light
 
penetration,
 
making
 
it

Safety  Considerations  and  Long-Term  Effects  While  generally  considered  safe,  PBM  is  not  entirely  without  potential  adverse  effects.  
Phototoxicity
 
can
 
occur
 
if
 
abnormal
 
or
 
excessive
 
amounts
 
of
 
chromophores
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
absorb
 
photons,
 
leading
 
to
 
molecular
 
changes
 
that
 
cause
 
cell
 
damage
 
and
 
localized
 
inflammatory
 
responses
 
similar
 
to
 
severe
 
sunburn.
4
 This  risk  necessitates  
careful
 
assessment
 
and
 
monitoring
 
of
 
patients
 
with
 
photosensitivity
 
reactions,
 
particularly
 
when
 
using
 
lower
 
wavelengths
 
with
 
high
 
red-light
 
content.

acknowledgement  of  phototoxicity  and  the  need  for  long-term  safety  studies  
introduces
 
a
 
crucial
 
cautionary
 
note,
 
balancing
 
the
 
generally
 
positive
 
outlook
 
on
 
PBM's
 
safety.
 
It
 
implies
 
that
 
while
 
PBM
 
is
 
considered
 
low-risk,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
entirely
 
benign,
 
especially
 
with
 
improper
 
application
 
or
 
in
 
sensitive
 
individuals,
 
necessitating
 
careful
 
clinical
 
oversight
 
and
 
continued
 
vigilance.
 
Moreover,  comprehensive  long-term  safety  studies  are  crucial  to  address  potential  
cumulative
 
effects
 
of
 
PBM,
 
as
 
current
 
extensive
 
data
 
in
 
this
 
area
 
remain
 
limited.
3
 The  
effectiveness
 
of
 
PBM
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
transient
,
 
often
 
requiring
 
ongoing
 
treatment
 
to
 
maintain
 
benefits.
4
 Additionally,  the  limited  penetration  depth  of  certain  
wavelengths
 
restricts
 
PBM’s
 
effectiveness
 
in
 
treating
 
deep-seated
 
tissues,
 
posing
 
a
 
challenge
 
for
 
systemic
 
or
 
deeply
 
affected
 
conditions.
4  
Methodological  Challenges  in  Clinical  Trials  Many  existing  studies  suffer  from  small  sample  sizes ,  which  are  often  not  
representative
 
enough
 
to
 
draw
 
robust
 
conclusions.
3
 A  significant  number  of  studies  
also
 
lack
 
suitable
 
control
 
groups
,
 
making
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
definitively
 
attribute
 
observed
 
improvements
 
solely
 
to
 
PBM.
3
 The  potential  influence  of  placebo  effects  in  PBM  
studies
 
necessitates
 
careful
 
consideration;
 
rigorously
 
controlled
 
sham
 
trials
 
are
 
critical
 
to
 
minimize
 
bias
 
and
 
ensure
 
reliable
 
conclusions,
 
as
 
differentiating
 
between
 
the
 
physiological
 
impact
 
of
 
PBM
 
and
 
psychological
 
effects
 
stemming
 
from
 
patient
 
expectations
 
can
 
be
 
challenging.
4  
Need  for  Predictive  Biomarkers  and  Combination  Therapies  Future  research  should  focus  on  identifying  predictive  biomarkers  for  personalized  
treatment
 
to
 
optimize
 
outcomes,
 
as
 
individual
 
responses
 
to
 
PBM
 
may
 
vary
 
significantly.
4
 The  emphasis  on  predictive  biomarkers  and  combination  therapies  
signals
 
a
 
shift
 
towards
 
personalized
 
medicine
 
and
 
integrated
 
treatment
 
approaches
 
for
 
PBM.
 
This
 
suggests
 
that
 
future
 
research
 
will
 
move
 
beyond
 
broad
 
efficacy
 
studies
 
to
 
identify
 
who
 
benefits
 
most
 
from
 
PBM
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
can
 
synergistically
 
enhance
 
existing
 
treatments,
 
thereby
 
optimizing
 
outcomes.
 
Research  into  combination  therapies  involving  PBM  and  other  established  
interventions
 
(e.g.,
 
cognitive-behavioral
 
therapy
 
for
 
insomnia,
 
pharmacological
 
treatments)
 
is
 
needed
 
to
 
explore
 
synergistic
 
benefits
 
and
 
facilitate
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
management
 
of
 
complex
 
disorders.
4
 Further  research  is  also  required  
to
 
examine
 
transcranial
 
PBM’s
 
precise
 
effects
 
on
 
specific
 
neural
 
pathways
 
involved
 
in
 
physiological
 
processes
 
like
 
sleep
 
regulation.
4
 While  some  evidence  suggests  
structural
 
benefits
 
(e.g.,
 
in
 
KOA),
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
PBM
 
to
 
offer
 
sustained
 
benefits
 
and

modify  the  underlying  progression  of  diseases  remains  insufficiently  explored,  
warranting
 
further
 
investigation.

Conclusion  and  Recommendations  Photobiomodulation  represents  a  promising  non-invasive  and  low-risk  therapeutic  
approach
 
with
 
a
 
distinct
 
mechanism
 
of
 
action
 
centered
 
on
 
stimulating
 
mitochondrial
 
function
 
and
 
initiating
 
a
 
cascade
 
of
 
beneficial
 
cellular
 
responses,
 
including
 
ATP
 
production,
 
modulation
 
of
 
signaling
 
molecules
 
like
 
ROS
 
and
 
NO,
 
and
 
anti-inflammatory
 
effects.

 The  consistent  identification  of  cytochrome  c  oxidase  as  
the
 
primary
 
chromophore
 
across
 
independent
 
research
 
sources
 
provides
 
a
 
strong
 
scientific
 
foundation
 
for
 
its
 
proposed
 
mechanisms.
1
 Its  broad  applicability  across  
various
 
physiological
 
systems,
 
from
 
neurodegenerative
 
and
 
psychiatric
 
disorders
 
to
 
sleep
 
regulation
 
and
 
musculoskeletal
 
conditions,
 
underscores
 
its
 
versatile
 
therapeutic
 
potential.
3  
Despite  these  promising  aspects,  the  field  faces  significant  challenges  that  currently  
limit
 
its
 
widespread
 
clinical
 
adoption.
 
The
 
pervasive
 
call
 
for
 
"standardization"
 
and
 
"larger,
 
well-controlled
 
trials"
 
across
 
multiple
 
independent
 
research
 
reviews
 
indicates
 
that
 
while
 
PBM
 
has
 
moved
 
beyond
 
anecdotal
 
evidence,
 
it
 
has
 
not
 
yet
 
fully
 
transitioned
 
into
 
an
 
evidence-based
 
medicine
 
paradigm
 
for
 
many
 
applications.
3
 This  highlights  a  
critical
 
need
 
for
 
the
 
scientific
 
community
 
to
 
coalesce
 
around
 
robust
 
methodologies
 
to
 
unlock
 
its
 
full
 
clinical
 
potential.
 
To  advance  PBM  from  a  promising  experimental  therapy  to  an  established  medical  
intervention,
 
the
 
following
 
recommendations
 
are
 
crucial:
 
●  Prioritize  Standardization  of  Protocols:  Urgent  efforts  are  needed  to  establish  
universally
 
accepted
 
and
 
rigorously
 
tested
 
protocols
 
for
 
PBM,
 
including
 
optimal
 
wavelengths,
 
power
 
densities,
 
doses,
 
treatment
 
durations,
 
and
 
delivery
 
methods.
 
This
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
ensure
 
reproducibility
 
and
 
comparability
 
across
 
studies,
 
which
 
are
 
fundamental
 
for
 
developing
 
reliable
 
clinical
 
guidelines.
 ●  Conduct  Rigorous  Clinical  Trials:  There  is  a  critical  need  for  larger-scale,  
well-controlled,
 
double-blind,
 
sham-controlled
 
clinical
 
trials
 
involving
 
diverse
 
and
 
homogenous
 
patient
 
populations.
 
These
 
trials
 
must
 
incorporate
 
long-term
 
follow-up
 
to
 
definitively
 
assess
 
sustained
 
efficacy
 
and
 
safety,
 
addressing
 
the
 
current
 
limitations
 
of
 
small
 
sample
 
sizes
 
and
 
lack
 
of
 
suitable
 
control
 
groups.
 ●  Investigate  Predictive  Biomarkers:  Future  research  should  focus  on  identifying  
specific
 
biological
 
markers
 
that
 
can
 
predict
 
individual
 
responses
 
to
 
PBM.
 
This
 
will
 
enable
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
personalized
 
treatment
 
strategies,
 
optimizing
 
therapeutic
 
outcomes
 
by
 
tailoring
 
interventions
 
to
 
patient-specific
 
needs.
 

--- Page 18 ---

●  Explore  Combination  Therapies:  Research  into  integrating  PBM  with  other  
established
 
medical
 
interventions,
 
such
 
as
 
pharmacological
 
treatments,
 
cognitive-behavioral
 
therapies,
 
or
 
physical
 
rehabilitation,
 
is
 
crucial.
 
This
 
approach
 
can
 
explore
 
synergistic
 
benefits
 
and
 
lead
 
to
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
and
 
effective
 
treatment
 
plans.
 ●  Elucidate  Precise  Mechanisms:  Continued  research  is  necessary  to  fully  unravel  
the
 
precise
 
cellular
 
and
 
molecular
 
mechanisms
 
underlying
 
PBM's
 
effects,
 
particularly
 
for
 
specific
 
conditions
 
and
 
tissue
 
types.
 
A
 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
these
 
mechanisms
 
will
 
allow
 
for
 
the
 
refinement
 
of
 
treatment
 
approaches
 
and
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
more
 
targeted
 
interventions.
 ●  Assess  Long-Term  Safety:  Comprehensive  studies  are  required  to  assess  the  
long-term
 
safety
 
profile
 
of
 
PBM,
 
including
 
potential
 
cumulative
 
effects.
 
This
 
is
 
vital
 
to
 
ensure
 
its
 
safe
 
and
 
responsible
 
application
 
over
 
extended
 
periods,
 
addressing
 
concerns
 
like
 
phototoxicity.
 ●  Educate  Stakeholders:  Accurate,  evidence-based  information  regarding  both  
the
 
promising
 
potential
 
and
 
the
 
current
 
limitations
 
of
 
PBM
 
must
 
be
 
widely
 
disseminated
 
to
 
clinicians,
 
researchers,
 
and
 
the
 
public.
 
This
 
will
 
foster
 
informed
 
decision-making
 
and
 
promote
 
the
 
responsible
 
use
 
of
 
PBM
 
as
 
it
 
continues
 
to
 
evolve.
