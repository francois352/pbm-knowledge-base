USB Power 
Plug
Connect the USB power 
plug [E] to the power 
adapter [H] as shown on 
page 1. Plug the power 
adapter to the mains and 
switch on the mains power.
Connect the nasal 
applicator plug [G] 
to the controller [A].
Insert the nasal 
applicator [F] into 
either the right or 
left nostril with the 
clip on the exterior 
and the lens inside 
the nostril.
Check the power button [C] on the 
device. If the power button displays a 
solid green light, it means that the 
device has power. Press the power 
button again to switch on the device. 
The green light will start blinking, 
indicating that the device is powered on. 
Additionally, check if the LED modules 
and the nasal applicator have lights.

The device will automatically switch oﬀ after 20 minutes, completing a 
session. If you wish to end the session before the 20-minute mark, press 
the power button to manually turn oﬀ the device.
1. Options to clean the nasal applicator:
    Wipe the nasal applicator gently with 70% alcohol or antiseptic wipes to help 
disinfect the surface.
    Clean the nasal applicator gently with soap and water. Rinse it thoroughly 
afterward and let it dry before using it again.
    Sanitize the nasal applicator with a UV lamp. Follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for proper usage.
2. For cleaning other surfaces, such as the device itself, use a soft, dry cloth to 
clean these surfaces. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the 
device.
3. It is important not to submerge any of the components on the neck module in 
liquid or cover them with other materials during use. This can cause damage to 
the device and aﬀect its functionality.
4. When storing the device, keep it in a dry and dust-free location. The recom-
mended temperature range for storage is between 10°C to 40°C (50°F to 104°F). 
It is also important to keep it away from direct sunlight, as prolonged exposure 
to sunlight can potentially damage the device.
5. Sharing devices and nasal applicators is not recommended, as it increases the 
risk of spreading infectious diseases. To maintain hygiene and minimize the 
chances of transmitting pathogens, it is best for each individual to have their 
own personal device and nasal applicator.
