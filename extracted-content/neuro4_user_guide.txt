The Neuro Duo has a selector switch [M] for Alpha and Gamma frequencies. The 
Neuro Alpha and Neuro Gamma  are single frequency mode devices.
We recommend users with a healthy brain to use the Alpha or Gamma frequen-
cies once every two days for maintenance.
Users looking to try to recover brain functions, should try the Alpha or the Gamma 
frequencies once daily for up to 6 days a week.
To avoid over stimulation, always take a rest from using the device on the 7th day 
and avoid using the Gamma frequency close to bedtime. Reduce usage to once 
every 2 days when signi/f_icant improvements are observed.
Usage of the device should not exceed one session of up to and not exceeding 20 
minutes  per day.
Everyone is diﬀerent and can have diﬀerent responses.  If any discomfort is 
experienced, users should reduce the time of each session by shutting oﬀ the 
device before its 20-minute session is up, by reducing the number of days used 
per week, or by doing both.
