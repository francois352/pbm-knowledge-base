# Introduction to Neurofeedback

Neurofeedback, also known as EEG biofeedback, is a non-invasive technique that teaches individuals to regulate their brain activity through real-time feedback.

## What is Neurofeedback?

Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback that uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain wave activity. By providing immediate feedback, individuals learn to self-regulate brain function, leading to improved mental and emotional states.

## How Does It Work?

The neurofeedback process involves several steps:

1. **Assessment**: A QEEG (quantitative EEG) brain map identifies areas of dysregulation
2. **Training**: Sensors are placed on the scalp to monitor brain activity
3. **Feedback**: Visual or auditory cues reward desired brain patterns
4. **Learning**: The brain learns to produce more optimal patterns over time

## Applications

Neurofeedback has been successfully used for:

### Mental Health
- Anxiety and depression
- ADHD and attention difficulties
- PTSD and trauma
- Sleep disorders

### Performance Enhancement
- Peak performance for athletes
- Academic achievement
- Creative flow states
- Stress management

### Neurological Conditions
- Migraines and headaches
- Epilepsy
- Traumatic brain injury
- Cognitive decline

## The Science Behind Neurofeedback

Neurofeedback is based on principles of neuroplasticity - the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. Through repeated training sessions, the brain learns to maintain healthier patterns of activity.

## What to Expect

### Initial Assessment
- Comprehensive intake and history
- QEEG brain mapping (recommended)
- Treatment plan development

### Training Sessions
- Typically 30-60 minutes
- 20-40 sessions recommended
- Progress monitored throughout

### Results Timeline
- Some notice changes within 5-10 sessions
- Full benefits typically after 20-40 sessions
- Long-lasting improvements common

## Neurofeedback + PBM Synergy

Combining neurofeedback with photobiomodulation can enhance results:
- PBM increases cellular energy for optimal brain function
- Neurofeedback trains specific brain patterns
- Together, they support comprehensive brain health

## Is Neurofeedback Right for You?

Neurofeedback may be beneficial if you:
- Experience chronic stress or anxiety
- Have attention or focus difficulties
- Want to optimize brain performance
- Seek drug-free treatment options
