# What is Photobiomodulation (PBM)?

Photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low-level light therapy or red light therapy, is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate biological processes in the body.

## How Does PBM Work?

PBM works by delivering red or near-infrared light to tissues, where it is absorbed by cellular chromophores, particularly cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria. This absorption triggers a cascade of beneficial cellular responses:

1. **Enhanced ATP Production**: Increased energy production in cells
2. **Improved Blood Flow**: Better circulation and oxygen delivery
3. **Reduced Inflammation**: Decreased inflammatory markers
4. **Cellular Repair**: Stimulation of healing processes

## Benefits of PBM

### Brain Health
- Enhanced cognitive function
- Improved mood and reduced anxiety
- Better sleep quality
- Neuroprotective effects

### Physical Wellness
- Reduced pain and inflammation
- Faster muscle recovery
- Improved wound healing
- Enhanced athletic performance

## Safety and Evidence

PBM has been extensively studied with over 5,000 peer-reviewed publications. It is considered safe when used as directed, with minimal side effects.

### Key Points:
- ✅ Non-invasive and painless
- ✅ No known serious side effects
- ✅ Can be used at home
- ✅ Backed by scientific research

## Getting Started with PBM

If you're interested in trying PBM therapy, consider:

1. **Consulting a Healthcare Provider**: Especially if you have specific health concerns
2. **Choosing Quality Devices**: Look for FDA-cleared or CE-marked devices
3. **Following Protocols**: Use recommended treatment durations and frequencies
4. **Being Consistent**: Regular use is key for optimal results
